"""
Simulated credential bait for the tool-output exfiltration demo.

SECURITY NOTES (for Unifai demo):
These are the well-known AWS SDK documentation placeholder credentials
(the values AWS itself publishes as examples, e.g. in the Boto3 and CLI
docs) - not real secrets. They exist so an uploaded prompt-injection
payload that asks an agent to "search for AWS credentials" has something
findable to simulate exfiltrating, without any real secret ever being at
risk.
